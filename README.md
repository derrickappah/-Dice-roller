# Dice Roller - 3D Realistic Dice with Three.js

This is a web-based 3D dice roller built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) with realistic rounded dice geometry, bump mapping, and smooth rolling animation. The dice rolls with a natural spin and easing effect, displaying the final result on the screen. It includes sound effects for dice rolling and button clicks.
